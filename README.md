# Twoge Comparison

## Overview

This web app gives you a tool to visually compare two images:

- Slider, split view, and fade comparison
- Zoom and movable images
- And more to explore

## How it Works

This app uses a slider (input range element) and CSS combined with DOM manipulation. Movable elements rely on touch and mouse event properties.

## How to Use

Assuming you've forked the repo and are running a local server or using the demo app:

1. Select an image for Image 1 and Image 2 using each input file.
2. After selecting both images, choose your desired comparison method (slider, split, or fade).
3. View the result and compare the images visually.
